They can then login with the valid credentials and are redirected to the bookings page where they can view the list of all possible buses and their routes along with its time. The user then chooses the desired bus as per his/her time convenience. After this, the user is required to fill in the payment details. He/she has the option to choose either cash or credit card as their payment option. If they choose the credit card option, then he/she would have to give in the card details and the amount will be deducted accordingly.
